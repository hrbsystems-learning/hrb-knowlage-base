For installing Docker on Ubuntu 20.04, the recommended approach is to use the official Docker repository rather than using snap. This method provides more control over the installation process and ensures you're getting the latest stable version directly from Docker.

Here's the better practice for installing Docker on Ubuntu 20.04:

Update the package index:

sudo apt-get update

Copy

Apply

Install packages to allow apt to use a repository over HTTPS:

sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common

Copy

Apply

Add Docker's official GPG key:

curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -

Copy

Apply

Set up the stable repository:

sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable"

Copy

Apply

Update the package index again:

sudo apt-get update

Copy

Apply

Install Docker CE:

sudo apt-get install docker-ce

Copy

Apply

This approach ensures you have the most up-to-date and stable version of Docker, with better integration and support for Ubuntu 20.04.

docker-compose is installed too, when install docker-ce via apt-get?



Claude 3.5 Sonnet
No, docker-compose is not automatically installed when you install docker-ce via apt-get. Docker Compose is a separate tool that needs to be installed independently. You would need to install docker-compose separately after installing docker-ce if you want to use it in your development environment.

how to install docker-compose after docker instalation via apt-get?



Claude 3.5 Sonnet
To install docker-compose after installing Docker via apt-get, you can follow these steps:

Download the latest stable release of Docker Compose:

sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/latest/download/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

Copy

Apply

Apply executable permissions to the binary:

sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

Copy

Apply

Verify the installation:

docker-compose --version

Copy

Apply

This method ensures you have the most recent version of Docker Compose directly from the official source. It's a straightforward and reliable way to add Docker Compose to your system after installing Docker CE.
